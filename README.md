# Python programming and data science course

This repo contains ipython notebooks with exercises (with solutions) to learn python programming, with an emphasis on data science. The first part of the course deals with basic python programming:

- Built-in classes (strings, lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Writing functions and classes
- Reading and writing files
- Some useful modules from the standard library

while the second part is dedicated to scientific and data analysis modules:

- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- pandas

Accompanying presentations are not available in this repository yet, but exercises and solutions should contain all relevant information.

## Installing relevant modules with conda

To install python with all modules relevant for this course you can simply use conda:

```
